Hello. 

This is my "Hello World" so-called project for the git-it npm module. 

I don't use git for work, so I must resort to other means to learn and practice. Did I mention that I have two young kids, and limited free time for side projects? C'est la vie!

Did you know that donuts contain eggs? It's true!
